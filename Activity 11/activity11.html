        <h1>COPY WHEEL EYE</h1>
        <p> <b><br>The Sharingan eyes are the unique hereditary Dojutsu of the Uchiha clan. Belonging to the three great Dojutsu,</br>
            <br>The Sharingan eyes literally mean Copy Wheel Eye or Mirror Wheel Eye owing to the fact that it enables its user to mimic their opponentâ€™s moves.</br>
            <br>This red-colored Dojutsu is one of the most popular eyes in the Narutoverse, as well as one of the strongest.</br>
            <br> There are three main types of Sharingan Eyes :</br>
            <br>Mangekyou Sharingan, Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, and the Tomoe Sharingan which consists of One Tomoe Sharingan, Two Tomoe Sharingan, and Three Tomoe Sharingan.</br>
            <br>Each of these eyes has distinct features, however, the typical Sharingan eye has one tomoe.</br></b></p>
