        <h1>COPY WHEEL EYE</h1>
        <p>The Sharingan eyes are the unique hereditary Dojutsu of the Uchiha clan. Belonging to the three great Dojutsu, the Sharingan eyes literally mean Copy Wheel Eye or Mirror Wheel Eye owing to the fact that it enables its user to mimic their opponentâ€™s moves. This red-colored Dojutsu is one of the most popular eyes in the Narutoverse, as well as one of the strongest.

There are three main types of Sharingan Eyes; Mangekyou Sharingan, Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, and the Tomoe Sharingan which consists of One Tomoe Sharingan, Two Tomoe Sharingan, and Three Tomoe Sharingan. Each of these eyes has distinct features, however, the typical Sharingan eye has one tomoe.</p>
